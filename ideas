Space to braindump possible ideas for our game

1) timer: (N)
  add a timer like the one in hw2 that will make a move for either player after a given amount 
  of inactivity (ex: 10 sec)
  
2) handicap options: (N)
  https://senseis.xmp.net/?Handicap
  -giving a player handicap stones (extra stones placed on board at the beginning) 
    **implement at least this^
    -could give user options for number of stones placed in a pattern
    -OR could let user place the handicaps at the beginning of the game?
  -giving a player reverse komi (white giving black extra points)
  -kosose: allowing 1 player to determine some of the others moves (way too hard)
  
 3) undo button: (N)
    if the user accidentally places a stone somewhere they didn't mean to, 
    they can press the undo button if its only been a couple sounds
