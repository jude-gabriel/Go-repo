player actions: 
 

1) Place stone (click the spot on the board, probably use buttons)
 1.1) black must always play first
 
-happy path: doesnt lead to a capture
-unhappy path: leads to a capture


2) Pass turn (button)
 2.1) if both players pass one after the other, the game is over 
-weird action
-for coding the end of the game


3) Quit game (button)
-choosing to forfeit, valid choice 
-common because of our game 

4) Capture
 -not something the user the user specifically clicks, but big action for us to implement
 
 

What we need to code: 

Capture (when stoned placed in right spot)

Increase stone counter

extra idea: 
-add music! (easy, maybe 2 hours) (fair use so its not copyrighted)
